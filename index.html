		<p> My working papers include an empirical paper on national innovation ecosystem in G20 countries and a theoretical paper on digital governance.  ons, I examine how personnel expertise and capabilities affect organizational performance, such as patenting innovations. Ongoing work ties these two streams of research together, looking at how individuals' organizational fit interacts with labor market demands, driven by changes in organizations' human capital needs.</p>
		<p> My presentations so far include (a) AoM Boston 2019 and (b) Wharton Corporate Strategy and Innovation Conference </p>
